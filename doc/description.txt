1. Development: Make a simple crud API for blog
    - Don't use frameworks or mini frameworks, you can only use third parties.
    - API should have REST endpoints for article model
    - You should only soft delete the articles
    - We expect endpoint for: Create, Update, Get one, Get all and Delete the articles
    - The solution should have authentication
    - Get and Get all endpoint should be public access, others should be allowed only for an authenticated user


2. Engineering: Make sure we can easily create and check the application by assuring you have
    - GIT installed, use github, bitbucket or any similar service.
    - Any type of virtualization (Vagrant, Docker).
    - The application can be build and installed using simple instructions.
    - Attach README.md for documentation.


3. Extra point will be give if your application has:
    - Unit / Functional Tests
    - POSTMAN collection showing access to each endpoints
    - You adhere to PSR standards.
    - You have a logging in place.
    - You thought through Security.
    - You thought through Scalability.
    - You thought through Design Patterns.
